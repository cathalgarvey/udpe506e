### say what?
- sends one UDP packet containing 508 `e`s to every address on the internet.
- eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
- uses port 101 (ASCII ordinal of `e`)
- I recommend you don't run it
- AGPL
- R.I.P [e30e/e98e](https://linuxwit.ch/blog/2018/12/e98e/)

### how do I build it?
please don't.  
(use rustc)

### it seems slow. how long should it take to run?
sending packets to all of IPv4 should take about 6 hours with a fast computer on a gigabit connection.  
sending them to all of IPv6 (which begins immediately after IPv4 is completed) will take at least 10
septillion years with the same setup. make sure to run it on a VPS provided by a company that will be 
around a while, like Amazon or Google.  

### how many e will this program send out in total?
if allowed to run until it stops, it will have transmitted precisely 
172863442395836739439394300577520094806016 `e`s, or roughly 1.7 trillion trillion quadrillion of them.  
one teraterapeta-e, if you will.  

### will you help me make a distributed version of this that I can run on a botnet I control?
no.
